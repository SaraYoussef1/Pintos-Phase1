# Pintos-Phase1
Pintos is a simple operating system that is developed at Stanford University.  
More information about pintos and installation environment is available here [Stanford Pintos Introduction](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html#SEC1)  

### Phase1: Threads
Pintos already has a minimally functional thread system.  
This phase aims to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems.  
More information about Phase1 is available here [Phase1: Threads](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_2.html#SEC15)
